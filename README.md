# data210_git_basics

Hello, this change was made on my local machine!

Here, we will look at the git commands we have been using.

Git add - places work onto a working copy

Git commit - places work as a snapshot onto a working repository??

Git push - places work into central repository (in this case... the main one on github). it is git practice to use "git push -u main"
